# Case and Troubles

- if file size > 50mb, sending from backend to frontend needs a lot of time,
    #[res to href with type] - trouble with performance on front

- blob, without trouble with performance on front, time is 2long also for sending files over 100mb,

- as static files? webpack trouble > virtual module? redirect to api?
